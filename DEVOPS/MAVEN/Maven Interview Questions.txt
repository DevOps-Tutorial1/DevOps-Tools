=> MAVEN Interview Questions:-
====================

1.What is Maven?
-------------------
>Maven is a project management tool. It provides the developer a complete build lifecycle framework. 
  On executing Maven commands, it will look for POM file in Maven; it will run the command on the resources described in the POM.
>Basically, Maven is nothing but a project management application. 
  Generally, Maven is used for such varied purposes as documentation, project development, reporting and releases. 
  The developer works on a set of predefined Maven commands in order to carry out the process.

uses:  Build, Documentation, Reporting, Dependencies, SCMs, Releases, Distribution, Mailing list



2.What is Build Tool?
-------------------------
A build tool takes care of everything for building a process. It does following:

*Generates source code (if auto-generated code is used)
*Generates documentation from source code
*Compiles source code
*Packages compiled code into JAR of ZIP file
*Installs the packaged code in local repository, server repository, or central repository



3) What are the advantages of Maven?
-----------------------------------------
*No need to add jar file in each project
*Creates right directory structure
*Builds and deploys the project



4.Maven Lifecycle with Explanation?
--------------------------------------
A Build Lifecycle is a well-defined sequence of phases, which define the order in which the goals are to be executed. Here phase represents a stage in life cycle. As an example, a typical Maven Build Lifecycle consists of the following sequence of phases.

Phase	    Handles	              Description
------          ---------                          ------------
.prepare-	   resource copying	              Resource copying can be customized in this phase.
 resources
.validate	   Validating the information	Validates if the project is correct and if all necessary information is available.
.compile	   compilation	              Source code compilation is done in this phase.
.Test	   Testing	                           Tests the compiled source code suitable for testing framework.
.package	   packaging	              This phase creates the JAR/WAR package as mentioned in the packaging in POM.xml.
.install	   installation	              This phase installs the package in local/remote maven repository.
.Deploy	   Deploying	              Copies the final package to the remote repository.


Maven has the following three standard lifecycles -

>clean
>default(or build)
>site
A goal represents a specific task which contributes to the building and managing of a project. It may be bound to zero or more build phases. A goal not bound to any build phase could be executed outside of the build lifecycle by direct invocation.

The order of execution depends on the order in which the goal(s) and the build phase(s) are invoked. For example, consider the command below. The clean and package arguments are build phases while the dependency:copy-dependencies is a goal.

5.How many repositories in maven?
--------------------------------------
A maven repository is a directory of packaged JAR file with pom.xml file. Maven searches for dependencies in the repositories. 
There are 3 types of maven repository:

>Local Repository
>Central Repository
>Remote Repository

Maven searches for the dependencies in the following order:

Local repository -> Central repository ->Remote repository.



6.What are the build phases in Maven?
-------------------------------------------
>validate
>compile
>test
>package
>integration-test
>verify
>install
>deploy


7.) Explain what is POM?
--------------------------
In Maven, POM (Project Object Model) is the fundamental unit of work. It is an XML file which holds the information about the project and configuration details used to build a project by Maven.



8) Explain what is Maven artifact?
------------------------------------
Usually an artifact is a JAR file which gets arrayed to a Maven repository. One or more artifacts a maven build produces such as compiled JAR and a sources JAR.

Each artifact includes a group ID, an artifact ID and a version string.



9) Why Maven Plugins are used?
-----------------------------------
Maven plugins are used to

>Create a jar file
>Create war file
>Compile code files
>Unit testing of code
>Documenting projects
>Reporting


10.What are the minimum requiremetns to creat project?
------------------------------------------------------------
Project requirements are an essential guideline to the project, but many people ignore them, favouring the opinion of the project team in terms of what they think the user wants and needs. ‘Without a thorough understanding of what the project is trying to accomplish, and sticking to that understanding, there is no chance of project success.’3 Some project requirements that must be defined are the project start date, scope, boundaries of the work, constraints in resources and people, project environment, deliverables, and budget.


11.System Requirements for maven?
------------------------------------------
Approximately 10MB is required for the Maven installation itself. In addition to that, additional disk space will be used for your local Maven repository. The size of your local repository will vary depending on usage but expect at least 500MB.
