=>JENKINS:- 
========

1. What is Jenkins?
---------------------
> Jenkins is a open source automation tool written in Java Programing Language that allows continuous Integration
> Jenkins Builds and Tests software projects which continuously making easier for developers to integrate changes the project,
   and making easier for users to obtain a fresh build.
> Jenkins achieves contineous Integration with the help of plugins.
   Plugins is used to allow the integration of various DevOps stages.
   If we want to integrate a perticular tool we have to install plugins for that tools.
   Example: Maven2, Git, HTML publisher, Amaon Ec2 etc. Jenkins supported by 400 above plugins

 Install Jenkins?
 -------------------------------
To install Jenkins, you just need to follow these five steps:

>Install Java Version 8                – Jenkins is a Java based application, hence Java is a must.
>Install Apache Tomcat Version 9 – Tomcat is essential to deploy Jenkins war file.
>Download Jenkins war File        – This war is must to install Jenkins.
>Deploy Jenkins war File            – You deploy Jenkins war file using Tomcat to run Jenkins.
>Install Suggested Plugins          – Install a list of plugins suggested by Jenkins.

Once the installation is complete, you will be able to see the Jenkins dashboard.


2.Explain what is continuous Integration?
--------------------------------------------
> Continuous integration is a process in which all development work is integrated as early as possible. 
> The resulting artifacts are automatically created and tested.
> This process allows to identify errors in an early stage of the project.


3.What is the requirements using jenkins?
---------------------------------------------
> A source code repository which is accessible, for instance, a Git repository
> A working build script, e.g., a Maven script, checked into the repository


4.Jenkins features?
--------------------
> Easy installation on various operating systems.
> Build Pipeline Support.
> Test hardness built around JUnit.
> Rapid release cycle.
> Extensible with the use of third-party plugins.
> Jenkins is a Opensource Tool
> It is free of cost, Easily configurable, Easily to install
> It is Build in Java & hence it is portable
> Easy support, since it opensource and widly used
> It is plateform independent
> Jenkins also support cloud base architecture
> It supports 1000 & more plugins to easy our work. It does not exist plugins, you can write the script for it and share with community.


4.Advantages of Jenkins?
---------------------------
> At integration stage, build failures are cached
> For each code commit changes an automatic build report notification generates
> To notify developers about build report success or failure, it is integrated with LDAP mail server
> Achieves continuous integration agile development and test driven development
> With simple steps, maven release project is automated
> Easy tracking of bugs at early stage in development environment than production


5.Explain how can MOVE & COPY jenkins from one server to another?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
> Move a job from one installation of Jenkins to another by simply copying the corresponding job directory.
> Make a copy of an existing job by making a clone of a job directory by a different name.
> Rename an existing job by renaming a directory. Note that if you change a job name you will need to change any other job that tries       to call the renamed job.


6.what are the commands you can use to start Jenkins manually?.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
To start Jenkins manually open Console/Command line, then go to your Jenkins installation directory. 
Over there you can use the below commands:

> Start Jenkins   : jenkins.exe start
> Stop Jenkins   : jenkins.exe stop
> Restart Jenkins: jenkins.exe restart


7.some of the useful plugins in Jenkin?
-------------------------------------------
Some of the important plugins in Jenkin includes
.Maven 2 project
.Amazon EC2
.HTML publisher
.Copy artifact
.Join
.Green Balls

8. Explain how you can deploy a custom build of a core plugin?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

To deploy a custom field of a core plugin, you have to do following things

> Stop Jenkins
> Copy the custom HPI to $Jenkins_Home/plugins
> Delete the previously expanded plugin directory
> Make an empty file called <plugin>.hpi.pinned
> Start Jenkins

9. Explain how can create a backup and copy files in Jenkins?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Jenkins saves all the setting, build artifacts and logs in its home directory, to create a back-up of your Jenkins setup, just copy this directory. You can also copy a job directory to clone or replicate a job or rename the directory.

10.Explain how you can clone a Git repository via Jenkins?
---------------------------------------------------------------

To clone a Git repository via Jenkins, you have to enter the e-mail and user name for your Jenkins system.  
For that, you have to switch into your job directory and execute the “git config” command.

11. Explain how you can set up Jenkins job?
------------------------------------------------

To create a project that is handled via jobs in Jenkins.  
Select New item from the menu, once this done enter a name for the job and select free-style job. 
Then click OK to create new job in Jenkins.  
The next page enables you to configure your job.

12. Mention what are the two components Jenkins is mainly integrated with?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jenkin is mainly integrated with two components

>Version Control system like GIT, SVN
>And build tools like Apache Maven.
 

13.What is the use of Pipelines in Jenkins?
-------------------------------------------
The pipeline can be defined as the suite of plugins supporting the implementation and integration of continuous delivery pipelines in Jenkins.

Types –
-------
>CI CD pipeline (Continuous Integration Continuous Delivery)
>Scripted pipeline
>Declarative pipeline

Uses:-
------
Pipeline plugin is used in Jenkins for making the Jenkins Pipeline, which gives us the view of stages or tasks to perform one after the other in the pipeline form. 
It models a series of related tasks. Pipelines help the teams to review, edit and iterate upon the tasks. 
Pipelines are durable and it can optionally stop and wait for human approval as well to start the next task. 
A pipeline is extensible and can perform work in parallel. It supports complex CD requirements.

14.How will you secure Jenkins?
--------------------------------
The way I secure Jenkins is mentioned below if you have any other way to do it than mention that:

>Make sure that the global security is on.
>Check if Jenkins is integrated with my company’s user directory with an appropriate plugin.
>Ensure that the matrix/Project matrix is enabled to fine-tune access.
>Automate the process of setting rights/privileges in Jenkins with custom version controlled script.
>Limit physical access to Jenkins data/folders.
>Periodically run security audits on the same.


15.Difference b/w Maven, Ant, Jenkins?
------------------------------------------

      Maven	                                                     Ant	                          Jenkins

  C#,Ruby.                                        C and C++.                                    Supports version control tools like Git, AccuRev.

>Executes Unit Tests as a part of         Supports single file execution            Can execute Apache Ant and Apache Maven
   the normal build cycle.	              introduced with Java II.	


16.Why should developers use Jenkins?
-------------------------------------------

>Easy to catch bugs early on.
>An automated testing process.
>Continuous integration.


17.What is Automated Testing?
---------------------------------
Automated testing is when a certain program (framework) tests your developed programs (web applications) 
without the need for human interference.

This is amazing because of several reasons – a lot of money and time are saved, testing happens much faster, there’s no room for any human-made error.


18.What are some of the most popular environment variables?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Keeping in mind that question most likely relates to Jenkins to build jobs, there are a lot of elemental variables that you could choose from. Here are a few of the more well-known ones:

$JOB_NAME
$JOB_URL
$WORKSPACE


19.What is the programming language used to build Jenkins?
------------------------------------------------------------------

JAVA

20.Can you write a simple Jenkins Pipeline Code for Java?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)
pipeline {
    agent { docker 'maven:3.3.3' }
    stages {
        stage('build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn --version'
            }
        }
    }
