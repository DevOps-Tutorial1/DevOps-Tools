Dividing the entire project into modules and delevering that in frequent.
Dilay updates with endUsers.

Disadvantages:
----------------
There is gap b/w the Developer and Operation team here. That mean , - Some times software not going to work on production environment but it is working on their local. - Deployments getting delayed( Manual Deployments) - If something went wrong roll back of package from prod server is getting time. - Developers need to wait a lot for Test results/feedback. - Dev Team focus on new changes and Ops team will focus on Product Stability.
Customer have a good Idea about the Requirement. Otherwise all are went in the wrong Direction.
Scrum Master is responsible for managing team. If not it will collapse.
More risk of sustainability, maintainability and extensibility.
