--------------
S3 is a safe place to store the files.
It is Object-based storage, i.e., you can store the images, word files, pdf files, etc.
The files which are stored in S3 can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB.
It has unlimited storage means that you can store the data as much you want.
Files are stored in Bucket. A bucket is like a folder available in S3 that stores the files.
S3 is a universal namespace, i.e., the names must be unique globally. Bucket contains a DNS address. Therefore, the bucket must contain a unique name to generate a unique DNS address.
If you create a bucket, URL look like:
