=>What is Cloud Computing?:-
==========================
 
 Cloud Computing can be defined as delivering computing power( CPU, RAM, Network Speeds, Storage OS software)
 a service over a network (usually on the internet) rather than physically having the computing resources at 
 the customer location.

Example: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud

Why Cloud Computing?:-
---------------------
With increase in computer and Mobile user’s, data storage has become a priority in all fields. Large and small 
scale businesses today thrive on their data & they spent a huge amount of money to maintain this data. 
It requires a strong IT support and a storage hub. Not all businesses can afford high cost of in-house 
IT infrastructure and back up support services. For them Cloud Computing is a cheaper solution. 
Perhaps its efficiency in storing data, computation and less maintenance cost has succeeded to attract 
even bigger businesses as well.

Benefits of Cloud Computing:
---------------------------
The potential for cost saving is the major reason of cloud services adoption by many organizations.  
Cloud computing gives the freedom to use services as per the requirement and pay only for what you use. 
Due to cloud computing it has become possible to run IT operations as a outsourced unit without much in-house 
resources.

Following are the benefits of cloud computing:

1.Lower IT infrastructure and computer costs for users
2.Improved performance
3.Fewer Maintenance issues
4.Instant software updates
5.Improved compatibility between Operating systems
6.Backup and recovery
7.Performance and Scalability
8.Increased storage capacity
9.Increase data safety

Disadvantages of Cloud Computing:
--------------------------------
There are various disadvantages of cloud computing technology. 
The important disadvantages of cloud computing are given below.

1) Require a constant Internet Connection:
   Cloud computing is impossible without Internet connection. To access any applications and documents you need a 
   constant Internet connection.

2) Require High Speed Internet connection:
   Similarly, a low-speed Internet connection makes cloud computing painful at best and often impossible. 
   Web based apps often require a lot of bandwidth to download, as need to download large documents.

3) Stored Data Might Not Be Secure:
   With cloud computing, all your data is stored in the cloud. That's all well and good, but how secure is the cloud? 
   Can't unauthorized users gain access to your confidential data?


=>Types of Clouds:-
==================
There are four different cloud models that you can subscribe according to business needs:

1.Private Cloud: Here, computing resources are deployed for one particular organization.  
                 This method is more used for intra-business interactions.  
			     Where the computing resources can be governed, owned and operated by the same organization.
2.Community Cloud: Here, computing resources are provided for a community and organizations. 

3.Public Cloud: This type of cloud is used usually for B2C (Business to Consumer) type interactions.  
                Here the computing resource is owned, governed and operated by government, an academic or 
		    	business organization. 
4.Hybrid Cloud: This type of cloud can be used for both type of interactions -  B2B (Business to Business) or 
                B2C ( Business to Consumer). This deployment method is called hybrid cloud as the computing resources 
			    are bound together by different clouds.
				
=>Cloud Computing Services:-
===========================

The three major Cloud Computing Offerings are

1.Software as a Service (SaaS)
2.Platform as a Service (PaaS)
3.Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

1.SaaS (Software as a Service):
-------------------------------
SaaS or software as a service is a software distribution model in which applications are hosted by a vendor or 
service provider and made available to customers over a network (internet). SaaS is becoming an increasingly 
prevalent delivery model as underlying technologies that supports Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) or Web Services. 
Through internet this service is available to users anywhere in the world. 

Traditionaly, software application needed to be purchased upfront &then installed it onto your computer. 
SaaS users on the other hand, instead of purchasing the software subscribes to it, usually on monthly basisvia 
internet.

Anyone who needs an access to a particular piece of software can be subscribe as a user, 
whether it is one or two people or every thousands of employees in a corporation. 
SaaS is compatible with all internet enabled devices.

Many important tasks like accounting, sales, invoicing and planning all can be performed using SaaS.


2.PaaS (Platform as a Service):
-------------------------------
Platform as a service, is referred as PaaS, it provides a platform and environment to allow developers to 
build applications and services. This service is hosted in the cloud and accessed by the users via internet.

To understand in a simple terms, let compare this with painting a picture, where you are provided with paint 
colors, different paint brushes and paper by your school teacher and you just have to draw a beautiful picture 
using those tools. 

PaaS services are constantly updated & new features added. Software developers, web developers and business 
can benefit from PaaS. It provides platform to support application development. It includes software support 
and management services, storage, networking, deploying, testing, collaborating, hosting and maintaining applications.

3.IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):
-----------------------------------
IaaS (Infrastructure As A Service) is one of the fundamental service model of cloud computing alongside 
PaaS( Platform as a Service). It provides access to computing resources in a virtualized environment “the cloud” 
on internet.  It provides computing infrastructure like virtual server space, network connections, bandwidth, 
load balancers and IP addresses. The pool of hardware resource is extracted from multiple servers and networks 
usually distributed across numerous data centers.  This provides redundancy and reliability to IaaS.

4.IaaS(Infrastructure as a service):
-----------------------------------
 is a complete package for computing. For small scale businesses who are looking for cutting cost on 
 IT infrastructure, IaaS is one of the solutions. Annually a lot of money is spent in maintenance and 
 buying new components like hard-drives, network connections, external storage device etc. which a business 
 owner could have saved for other expenses by using IaaS.
 
=>What is Cloud Computing Architecture?:
=======================================
Let’s have a look into Cloud Computing and see what Cloud Computing is made of. Cloud computing comprises 
of two components front end and back end.  Front end consist client part of cloud computing system. 
It comprise of interfaces and applications that are required to access the cloud computing platform.

While back end refers to the cloud itself, it comprises of the resources that are required for cloud computing services.
 It consists of virtual machines, servers, data storage, security mechanism etc. It is under providers control.

Cloud computing distributes the file system that spreads over multiple hard disks and machines. 
Data is never stored in one place only and in case one unit fails the other will take over automatically. 
The user disk space is allocated on the distributed file system, while another important component is algorithm 
for resource allocation. Cloud computing is a strong distributed environment and it heavily depends upon strong 
algorithm. 

=>Virtualization in Cloud Computing:
====================================
   Virtualization is the "creation of a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, such as a server, 
   a desktop, a storage device, an operating system or network resources".

   In other words, Virtualization is a technique, which allows to share a single physical instance of a resource 
   or an application among multiple customers and organizations. It does by assigning a logical name to a 
   physical storage and providing a pointer to that physical resource when demanded.
   
   
Virtualization and Cloud Computing:-
===================================

The main enabling technology for Cloud Computing is Virtualization. Virtualization is a partitioning 
of single physical server into multiple logical servers.  Once the physical server is divided, each logical 
server behaves like a physical server and can run an operating system and applications independently.  
Many popular companies’s like VmWare and Microsoft provide virtualization services, 
where instead of using your personal PC for storage and computation, you use their virtual server. 
They are fast, cost-effective and less time consuming.

For software developers and testers virtualization comes very handy, as it allows developer 
to write code that runs in many different environments and more importantly to test that code.


 
Virtualization is mainly used for three main purposes 

1) Network Virtualization 
2) Server Virtualization  
3) Storage Virtualization

Network Virtualization:  It is a method of combining the available resources in a network by splitting up the 
                         available bandwidth into channels, each of which is independent from the others and each 
						 channel is independent of others and can be assigned to a specific server or device in 
						 real time.

Storage Virtualization: It is the pooling of physical storage from multiple network storage devices into what appears 
                        to be a single storage device that is managed from a central console. 
                        Storage virtualization is commonly used in storage area networks (SANs).

Server Virtualization: Server virtualization is the masking of server resources like processors, RAM, 
                       operating system etc, from server users. The intention of server virtualization is to 
					   increase the resource sharing and reduce the burden and complexity of computation from users.

Virtualization is the key to unlock the Cloud system, what makes virtualization so important for the cloud 
is that it decouples the software from the hardware. For example, PC’s can use virtual memory to borrow 
extra memory from the hard disk. Usually hard disk has a lot more space than memory. Although virtual disks 
are slower than real memory, if managed properly the substitution works perfectly. Likewise, there is software 
which can imitate an entire computer, which means 1 computer can perform the functions equals to 20 computers.


Grid Computing Vs Cloud Computing:
=================================
When we switch on the fan or any electric device, we are less concern about the power supply from where it 
comes and how it is generated. The power supply or electricity that we receives at our home travels through 
a chain of network, which includes power stations, transformers, power lines and transmission stations. 
These components together make a ‘Power Grid’. Likewise, ‘Grid Computing’ is an infrastructure that links 
computing resources such as PCs, servers, workstations and storage elements and provides the mechanism required 
to access them.


Utility Computing Vs Cloud Computing:
====================================
In our previous conversation in “Grid Computing” we have seen how electricity is supplied to our house, 
also we do know that to keep electricity supply we have to pay the bill. Utility Computing is just like that, 
we use electricity at home as per our requirement and pay the bill accordingly likewise you will use the services 
for the computing and pay as per the use this is known as ‘Utility computing’. Utility computing is a good source
for small scale usage, it can be done in any server environment and requires Cloud Computing.


Security concerns for Cloud Computing:
======================================
While using cloud computing, the major issue that concerns the users is about its security. 

One concern is that cloud providers themselves may have access to customer’s unencrypted 
data- whether it’s on disk, in memory or transmitted over the network. 


Privacy Concern & Cloud Computing:
=================================
Privacy present a strong barrier for users to adapt into Cloud Computing systems

There are certain measures which can improve privacy in cloud computing.

The administrative staff of the cloud computing service could theoretically monitor the data moving in memory 
before it is stored in disk.To keep the confidentiality of a data, administrative and legal controls should 
prevent this from happening.
The other way for increasing the privacy is to keep the data encrypted at the cloud storage site, preventing 
unauthorized access through the internet; even cloud vendor can’t access the data either.
