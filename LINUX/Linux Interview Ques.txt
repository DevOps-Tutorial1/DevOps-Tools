25. Diff between softkink and hardlink ??

      Soft link :- 1. Size of the original file is equal to no.of characters in the name of original file
                      2. can be created across the partition
                      3. Inode no.of source & link file is difficult
                      4. If original file is deleted , the link is broken and data is lost

      Hard link:- 1. Size of both files same
                      2. Can't be created across the partition
                      3. Inode no.of both files is same
                      4. If original file deleted then also link will contain data

         Options: -A (append), -C(check), -D(delete)
      
35. Run levels in Booting procedure ??

    # BIOS, MBR, GRUB, Kernel, Init, Runlevel(run level 0,1,2,3,4,5,6)
			
36. Stateless & Statefull security group ??

Stateless Protocol is a network protocol in which Client send request to the server and server response back as per the given state. 
Ex:- HTTP, UDP, DNS
Stateful Protocol is a network protocol in which if client send a request to the server then it expects some kind of response, in case of no response then it resend the request.

37.Multi leyer docker ?? or How to reduce the docker image size ??

     Tip #1?—?Use a smaller base image
     Tip #2?—?Don’t install debug tools like vim/curl
     Tip #3?—?Minimize Layers
     Tip #4 Use?—?no-install-recommends on apt-get install
     Tip #5 Add rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* to same layer as apt-get installs
